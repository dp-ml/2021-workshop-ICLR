HEADER

Edit the values in the block above to be appropriate for your workshop.
If the value is not 'true', 'false', 'null', or a number, please use
double quotation marks around the value, unless specified otherwise.
And run 'make workshop-check' *before* committing to make sure that changes are good.

Check SWC curriculum

{% unless site.curriculum == "swc-inflammation" or site.curriculum == "swc-gapminder" %}
<div class="alert alert-warning">
It looks like you are setting up a website for a Software Carpentry curriculum but you haven't specified the curriculum type in the <code>_config.yml</code> file (current value in <code>_config.yml</code>: "<strong>{{ site.curriculum }}</strong>", possible values: <code>swc-inflammation</code>, or <code>swc-gapminder</code>). After editing this file, you need to run <code>make serve</code> again to see the changes reflected.

EVENTBRITE

This block includes the Eventbrite registration widget if
'eventbrite' has been set in the header.  You can delete it if you
are not using Eventbrite, or leave it in, since it will not be
displayed if the 'eventbrite' field in the header is not set.

The scope of this workshops includes, but is not limited to:
Special track: privacy of ML and data analytics in pandemic
Distributed Machine Learning
Federated Learning and Split Learning
Differential Privacy in Deep Learning
Privacy and security attacks (Model Inversion, Membership Inference etc.)
Practical Considerations for Distributed Learning (Communication Efficiency, Compression)
Model and data fingerprinting/watermarking methods
Non i.i.d, sequential and online distributed learning
Differential privacy and other statistical notions of privacy: theory, applications, and implementations
Secure multi-party computation techniques for ML
Learning on encrypted data
Hardware-based approaches to privacy-preserving ML
Trade-offs between privacy and utility
Empirical and theoretical comparisons between different notions of privacy
Policy and Compliance for Data Privacy
Privacy applications in the real world ( including but not limited to Autonomous Systems, Social Networks)
Interplay between privacy and adversarial robustness in machine learning
Relations between privacy, fairness and transparency

The focus of this workshop is to bring together researchers from industry and academia that focus on both distributed and private machine learning. These topics are of increasingly large commercial and policy interest. It is therefore important to build a community for this research area, which collaborating researchers that share insights, code, data, benchmarks, training pipelines, etc and together aim to advance distributed and private machine learning.

SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.
